The Blood Management System (BMS) is a comprehensive  Application designed to streamline the process of blood donation and distribution. It serves as a vital link between donors, recipients, and managers, ensuring efficient and safe blood transfusion services.

Donors: Donors are the backbone of the system. They voluntarily donate blood, contributing to the life-saving inventory. The system allows donors to register, schedule appointments for blood donation, and track their donation history. It also provides health-related guidelines to ensure the safety of both donors and recipients.
Recipients: Recipients are individuals or entities in need of blood. The system allows recipients to register, request specific blood types, and track the status of their requests. It also provides necessary information about the safe receipt and use of blood products.
Managers: Managers play a crucial role in approving requests from both donors and recipients, ensuring the smooth operation of the system. They monitor the inventory of blood, track the status of donations and requests, and manage the distribution of blood products. They also maintain the quality and safety standards of the system.
The BMS is designed with a user-friendly interface and robust functionality, ensuring a seamless experience for all users. It leverages advanced algorithms for efficient matching of donors and recipients and real-time tracking of blood inventory. The system adheres to all regulatory standards and guidelines, ensuring the highest level of safety and efficiency in blood management.
